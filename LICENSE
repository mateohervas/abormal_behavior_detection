We (Mateo Hervas and Christian Fernandez), owners of this project hereby licence this code as an MIT Licence because we firmly
believe that the essence of any researcher is to promote the development of our society in a sustainable way. And what a better
way to do it than giving our research to the community so together we can build something great that will benefit as all. 
Nevertheless, we only ask for recognition and citing when using this project for future research.
